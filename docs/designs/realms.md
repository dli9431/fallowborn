# Realms, the liege hierarchy & tiers

**Realms form a liege hierarchy.** Every realm has a `rank` (1 count … 4 emperor) and a
`liege` (realm id or null). `state.owner[pid]` is the SOVEREIGN top realm (map color,
war target); `state.holder[pid]` is the county's direct holder. Authored realms are
kings/emperors/independent dukes plus a few authored vassal kingdoms; the dukes and
counts inside them are generated at `FB.initPolitics` (`FB.makeVassalRealm`). De jure
data (`FBDATA.empires/kingdoms/duchies` + each county's `duchy` field) drives tier
promotions (`FB.checkTierPromotions` = majority of a duchy/kingdom/empire), realm
naming, and the Land panel's hierarchy block. Helpers: `FB.topRealm`, `FB.liegeChain`,
`FB.realmTerritory`, `FB.realmHeldCounties`, `FB.dejureOf`; owner/holder-derived lists
are cached per turn (`FB.invalidateRealmCache` on transfers). Vassals make no foreign
policy; strong vassals occasionally break away (`balance.breakawayChance`). The player
interacts with the whole chain (petition / `pay_homage` / `appeal_lord` /
`swear_fealty` / independence) and, once sovereign, runs vassals of their own
(`grant_land` — a single county via `FB.grantCounty` or a whole de jure duchy via
`FB.grantDuchy`, `demand_taxes`, `revoke_county`; vassal opinion lives in
`player.liegeOps`, taxes flow through `FB.playerTax` at `balance.vassalTaxRate` and a
share of levies through `FB.playerLevy` at `balance.vassalLevyRate`).
Petitioning up from a barony (`title_request` → `FB.grantByLiege`) invests the player
with his home county: the granting count yields it (dissolving if left landless) and
the player answers to the granter's own liege — a liege must outrank his man, and
`FB.checkTierPromotions` walks broken chains back up. Independence comes two ways:
the random `independence_offer` event or the explicit `declare_independence` deed
(200+ prestige, any sworn tier) — both run `FB.doIndependence`, which founds the
player realm and starts a defensive war against the old sovereign; a baron doing
either seizes his home county via `FB.transferProvince` (burying the old holder if
left landless).

**Inside a realm, counties also change hands without war.** A vassal house carries a
`favor` standing at its liege's court (−100…100, drifting yearly in `FB.worldTick`).
The Deeds tab offers three intra-realm paths to a neighbor's county, all following the
grant pattern (`state.holder[pid]` flips to `'player'`, `owner` and the player's liege
untouched, landless holders buried by `FB.realmBuryIfEmpty`): *Petition for a
neighbor's fief* (`petition_county` → `UI.showPetitionCounty` → the `county_petition`
event — gated on liege opinion, prestige, and the lifetime `player.warService` tally
built by riding with the liege's host, against the victim's `favor`); *Buy out a weak
neighbor* (`buy_county`, a vassal-only gold sink for adjacent rank-1 counts with no
vassals of their own); and *Settle the wasteland* (`settle_waste` → `FB.settleWaste`,
which turns a bordering wasteland province into a true county of the player's demesne —
settler culture and faith, belonging to no de jure duchy). Separately, a dying petty
count may leave no heir (`balance.escheatChance`, `FB.escheatRealm` in the yearly
tick): the fief escheats to the liege unless a bordering player of the same sovereign
wins the scramble (liege opinion, prestige, service) — and heirless fiefs of the
player's own vassals simply return to the player's hand.
AI rulers stay lightweight `realm.ruler` objects (name, culture, age, martial), not
full chars — the Deeds banner's "vassal of X" links to their sheet via
`UI.showLiegeModal` (`data-liege` click delegation), not `UI.showCharModal`.

**Tiers** 0–7 (serf…emperor) + `profession` gate actions (`js/actions.js`) and events. Map
ownership only begins at tier 4 (`state.player.provs`); tier 3 (baron) is a status inside a
county — and bound to it: a baron's liege is always the county's direct holder, so if his
lord's house dies — or the county changes hands under a living lord — the baron reattaches
to whoever holds his home (`FB.transferProvince`, with a catch-all repair in
`FB.checkTierPromotions`), never standing "independent" nor kneeling to a lord who no
longer holds his home. Tier-2 (gentry) content gates on tier alone, not profession, so the clergy careers
share it: an abbot or qadi keeps the cloth (`tierSet` in `js/events.js` preserves
monk/priest) but manages the manor and may petition for a barony like any gentry. Promotions above count happen in `FB.checkTierPromotions` from de jure majorities:
a duchy for tier 5, a kingdom (independent) for 6, two kingdoms of one empire for 7.
The exact rules live in `FB.duchyProgress`/`FB.kingdomProgress`/`FB.empireProgress`
(`js/world.js`), shared by the tier check and the UI readouts: a duchy must span ≥2 de
jure counties and demands ≥ max(2, ⌈n/2⌉) held, a kingdom ⌈n/2⌉, an empire two kingdom
majorities. Wastelands and colonies settled on them have no de jure duchy, so they count
toward no title. The province panel spells out have/need for the tapped county (and flags
lands that feed no title) under a row labeled "De jure (rightful liege)" — How to Play
glosses the term in plain language — and the 🗺/R map filter has de jure duchy and
kingdom modes that name the player's strongest claim.

**A lord holds only so much in his own hand.** Tier dignity counts every county the
player's *realm* controls — held directly or by a vassal beneath him in the chain
(`playerShare` in `js/world.js` walks each county's holder up the liege chain to
`'player'`), so granting land to vassals never costs progress toward a duchy, kingdom,
or empire. That frees a **domain limit**: the player may hold at most
`balance.domainBase + ⌊stewardship / balance.domainStewPer⌋` counties directly
(`FB.domainCap`); each county over the cap multiplies his *own* demesne income and levy
by `1 − balance.overDomainPenalty` (`FB.domainPenalty`, applied inside `FB.playerTax`
and `FB.playerLevy` — vassal dues and vassal levies are never penalized). The remedy is
the `grant_land` deed: enfeoff the surplus to a new count (`FB.grantCounty`, realm
`pv_<pid>`) or — only when every de jure county of a duchy sits in the player's own
hand (`FB.grantableDuchies`) — raise a duke over the whole duchy (`FB.grantDuchy`, realm
`pd_<did>`, holding all its counties directly), who then renders `vassalTaxRate` of its
counties' tax and `vassalLevyRate` of their levy back to you.

**Tiers can fall as well as rise.** The downfall chains (`df_*` in `data/events_noble.js`)
give rulers three slow cascades — a commons' revolt (tier 4+, low popular opinion), a
rival's claim, and a murder conspiracy (tier 3+, a rival with deep hatred) — each three
flag-marked stages with a paid or skill escape at every step. Only repeated neglect or
bad luck reaches the final stage, whose failure calls `FB.loseAllLand` (js/world.js):
a sovereign's realm passes whole to a generated usurper realm (same name and color; the
fallen house's vassals reattach to it), a vassal's fiefs escheat to his liege, and the
family drops to landless gentry (tier 2) keeping gold, items, and holdings. Succession
wipes the slide flags with the rest of `player.flags`, so a stalled plot never outlives
its generation. Province-by-province loss in a lost defensive war (`FB.warLoseProvince`)
remains the other way down, landing at the same tier 2.
