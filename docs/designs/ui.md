# UI: keyboard & mobile

**Keyboard support is a requirement** (`js/keys.js` + focus management in `ui.js`): the game
must stay fully playable mouse-free on desktop. New buttons/dialogs need to stay reachable —
modals autofocus their first control, list dialogs get 1–9 / ⇧1–⇧9 `keyhint` badges via
`UI.openModal` (`UI.hintFor`; Shift+digit reaches items 10–18, resolved by physical key
code in keys.js), and dialogs that must not be Esc-dismissed pass `{dismissable:false}`.

**Mobile layout lives in css/style.css.** `#panels` wraps the two side panels — invisible
on desktop (`display:contents`). On phones the Deeds/Land/Chronicle panel takes the full
width and Self/Kin becomes a drawer (`#left` fixed, shown by `body.showself` — toggled in
`setTab`, opened by tapping the topbar portrait, closed by `#btn-closeself`). The time
controls become a fixed thumb-zone bar above the drawer (hidden by `body.picking` during
the birthplace pick), modals render as bottom sheets, and touch targets stay ≥44 px with
safe-area insets. Hover-only affordances need a tap path (item chips toast their
description).

Related: [items.md](items.md) for the item card's hover/tap duality.

**Heraldry is procedural** (`FB.drawCrest` in js/util.js, seeded by house name or realm id —
the same seed gives the same shield everywhere, from the topbar to the liege sheet).
Character cards carry the character's house arms and the arms of the realm holding their
home county (`FB.homeOf` resolves the county). `FB.paintFaces` also paints every
`canvas.crest[data-seed]` under its root, so any panel that renders faces gets crests for
free.
