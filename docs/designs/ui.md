# UI: keyboard & mobile

**Keyboard support is a requirement** (`js/keys.js` + focus management in `ui.js`): the game
must stay fully playable mouse-free on desktop. New buttons/dialogs need to stay reachable —
modals autofocus their first control, list dialogs get 1–9 / ⇧1–⇧9 `keyhint` badges via
`UI.openModal` (`UI.hintFor`; Shift+digit reaches items 10–18, resolved by physical key
code in keys.js), and dialogs that must not be Esc-dismissed pass `{dismissable:false}`.
`UI.openModal` also takes `{modalClass}` to tag `#genmodal` with a per-dialog CSS modifier
(cleared on the next open) — the Changelog uses it for its own mobile layout.

**Mobile layout lives in css/style.css.** `#panels` wraps the two side panels — invisible
on desktop (`display:contents`). On phones the Deeds/Land/Chronicle panel takes the full
width and Self/Kin becomes a drawer (`#left` fixed, shown by `body.showself` — toggled in
`setTab`, opened by tapping the topbar portrait, closed by `#btn-closeself`). The time
controls become a fixed thumb-zone bar above the drawer (hidden by `body.picking` during
the birthplace pick), modals render as bottom sheets, and touch targets stay ≥44 px with
safe-area insets. In portrait the topbar wraps to two rows: identity and ☰ up top, the
four resources on their own full-width row below (a single row clips its leftmost stats
on narrow screens). The Changelog is the one exception (`.changelog-modal`): an evenly
margined centered panel whose body scrolls under a Close button pinned to the bottom middle. Hover-only affordances need a tap path (item chips toast their
description).

## Localization

Settings exposes English plus French, German, Italian, and Spanish as AI-translated Preview
locales. The preference is browser-local and takes effect after a reload. The selected
query-free locale script is loaded before final catalog validation; a missing, stale, or
invalid catalog falls back to English and records a diagnostic instead of blocking boot.
Settings is reachable from both the title screen and the in-game menu. Changing language
during a life autosaves before reloading; observe mode remains intentionally unsaved.

Authored static controls use `data-i18n`, `data-i18n-title`, and `data-i18n-aria-label`.
Completed modal and panel trees may receive an exact-source localization pass for legacy
markup, but localization must never replace substrings or fragments inside mixed text.
Dynamic UI uses message keys or localized parts plus proper names. Rendered messages are
plain text and substitutions are escaped before insertion into HTML.

New UI must tolerate longer translations, keep translated labels out of fixed-width
assumptions, preserve keyboard focus and accessible names, and remain usable in the mobile
bottom-sheet layouts. The pseudo-locale is the development check for expansion and missed
routing.

**Heraldry is procedural** (`FB.drawCrest` in js/util.js, seeded by house name or realm id —
the same seed gives the same shield everywhere, from the topbar to the liege sheet).
Character cards carry the character's house arms and the arms of the realm holding their
home county (`FB.homeOf` resolves the county). `FB.paintFaces` also paints every
`canvas.crest[data-seed]` under its root, so any panel that renders faces gets crests for
free.
