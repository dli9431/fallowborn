# Mods

**Mods** (`js/mods.js`) merge JSON from localStorage over `FBDATA` **before** world
generation — anything reading FBDATA at load time must run after `FB.mods.applyStored()` in
the boot path. Same-`id` entries replace; new ids are added. A mod's optional cosmetic
`name` labels it on the title screen (`refreshTitle` in main.js) and in the Mods dialog
(which lists active mods with per-mod removal); re-applying a same-name mod replaces the
stored copy.

Saves store only province/realm ids, so map changes can orphan old saves — every save is
therefore stamped with `FB.mods.sig()` (the `mods` field in save.js, covering stored mods
and enabled bundled mods alike) and `G.loadSlot` refuses to load a save whose mod set
differs from the active one.

**Bundled mods** (`mods/*.js`) register
`{id, name, desc, data}` into `window.FBMODS` via a script tag after the data files; the
Mods dialog toggles them, and enabled ids persist in localStorage (`fb_mods_bundled`) and
apply ahead of pasted mods.
